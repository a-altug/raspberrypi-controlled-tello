# Raspberry Pi Zero Controlled DJI Tello Drone

I recently bought DJI Tello and was amazed on how much you can learn and do with this little drone since it offers the ability to program. To start my learning, I decided to take inspiration from one of my pet projects on [controlling a RaspberryPi rover with Xbox One S Bluetooth Controller](https://github.com/erviveksoni/xbox-raspberrypi-rover).
I took the same code base and extended it to control the Tello using a easy to use and well documented python library [TelloPy](https://github.com/hanyazou/TelloPy).

While working on this application, I thought it would be a really cool idea to mount the Raspberry Pi Zero on top of the Tello itself rather then using the zero as a base station and keeping it on the ground.

Offcourse this adds additional weight to the drone (and reduce flying time) but for the application I am looking it was OK!
